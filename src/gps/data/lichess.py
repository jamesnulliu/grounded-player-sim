"""Lichess PGN -> per-player :class:`~gps.train.base.Trajectory`.

The Lichess open database (https://database.lichess.org/, CC0) ships one
``.pgn.zst`` per month of *all* rated games, ordered chronologically -- **not**
by player. So ingestion is: stream the archive once, parse each game into a
light stdlib :class:`GameRecord`, bucket records by player, then assemble each
player's records into a time-ordered ``Trajectory`` (one ``DecisionPoint`` +
``Observation`` per move *that player* made).

Design boundary (so the framework stays portable, design.md section 11)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The only function that touches ``python-chess`` / ``zstandard`` is the parser
(:func:`iter_game_records` / :func:`open_pgn`); it emits :class:`GameRecord` /
:class:`PlyRecord`, which are **pure stdlib**. Everything downstream
(:func:`bucket_by_player`, :func:`player_stats`, :func:`build_trajectory`)
works on those records with no heavy import, so the assembly logic -- the part
with the subtle correctness traps (history aliasing, session position, clock
arithmetic) -- is unit-testable on any box. A non-game domain reuses the
downstream half wholesale and only writes a new parser.

The engine oracle is **not** attached here. Per-move centipawn loss is
expensive and we are still deciding eval-set-vs-Stockfish empirically
(:mod:`gps.games.oracles`), so ``build_trajectory`` takes an *optional* oracle
and leaves ``engine_reference=None`` when none is given. Filtered trajectories
without oracle values are cheap to produce and re-usable.
