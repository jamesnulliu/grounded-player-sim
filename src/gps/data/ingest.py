"""Production ingest driver: Lichess archive -> persisted E-C dataset.

Turns the validated data layer (:mod:`gps.data.lichess`) into the actual
dataset E-C1/2/3 read. Two passes over one ``.pgn.zst`` archive:

1. **Cheap stats pass** (header-only, :func:`iter_game_summaries`): bucket
   every player, count games + sessions, and pick the cohort with enough
   volume *and* multi-session history (the future-behaviour split needs both).
   Restricted to a single speed class so think-time stays comparable.
2. **Full parse pass** (sharded, :func:`iter_game_records_parallel`): parse
   only the cohort's games into trajectories and **persist** them, so no
   experiment ever re-parses the archive.

The engine oracle is intentionally *not* attached (centipawn loss is expensive
and gates only E-C4/5/6, not the E-C1/2/3 next-move-NLL headline); trajectories
carry ``fen_before`` + ``legal_actions``, which is all next-move-NLL needs.

Output (``out_dir``)::

    dataset.jsonl.gz   # the TrajectoryDataset (gps.data.store format)
    manifest.json      # archive + params + per-player counts (reproducibility)
